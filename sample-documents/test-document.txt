Document Reader Test File

This is a sample text document to test the Document Reader application.

The application uses PyTorch and various AI models to analyze and extract text from different document formats including:

1. Plain text files (.txt)
2. PDF documents (.pdf)
3. Microsoft Word documents (.docx)
4. Image files with text (.jpg, .png, .jpeg, .bmp, .tiff)

Key Features:
- AI-powered text extraction
- Confidence scoring using machine learning models
- Real-time processing with performance metrics
- Modern Angular frontend with responsive design
- FastAPI backend with automatic documentation

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: Angular 17, TypeScript, RxJS
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, PyTorch
- AI/ML: Transformers, DistilBERT, Tesseract OCR
- Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

This document contains enough text to demonstrate the text quality analysis feature, which uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model to assess the readability and coherence of extracted content.

The application is designed to handle various document types and provide meaningful feedback about the extraction process, including confidence scores and processing times.
